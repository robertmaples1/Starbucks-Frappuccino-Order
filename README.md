# Starbucks-Frappuccino-Order
MATLAB code for ordering an inputted number of custom frappuchinos for a inputted group number. Inputs for additions (Chocolate, Whipped 
Cream, Caramel, Espresso) are entered for each frappuchino. The price for every order is calculated, and each persons order is displayed
with its subtotal price. The price for the total order is calculated and the group is prompted for payment. If requested, the
receipt for the whole order is created using a MATLAB figure.
